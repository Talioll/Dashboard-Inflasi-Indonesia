# Interactive Shiny Apps Dashboard 
The aim of this project is to create an interative dashboard using shiny to deliver the information of Indonesia's Inflation through 2005 - 2011. You can obtain the relevant data that I used from [Badan Pusat Statistik](https://www.bps.go.id/) from period 2005 - 2011. The outcome of this project can be seen in this link [Dashboard Inflasi Indonesia](https://taliathaib.shinyapps.io/Dashboard_Inflasi_Indonesia/)
